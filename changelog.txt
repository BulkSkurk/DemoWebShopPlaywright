  Started designing more test suites. Spent several hours trying to figure out why adding function
  in the address section seems to work but not delete. Turns out it's actually broken and doesn't work when 
  testing it manually either, will have to abandon the delete-test for the moment.

  Going along nicely. Remember to assert more.
  Check the price and info and see to it that it is selected for delivery address
  Also check the PDF to see that the info is correctly saved onto the .pdf

  Spent a lot of time trying to figure out why the login function refuses to give the proper response header.
  Turned out the server sends out a "blocked/not allowed" response when trying to automate it, also will not
  return authentification token despite login info being correct and in the correct format. Really odd.

  In the end I went for another approach. The test-suite will run an intial login the normal way using fill
  and then save the api response, parse the response for the auth token and save it for reusing later on.

  Cleaned up a little bit and started building a test to test the wishlist. It will navigate the page, adding some
  items to the wishlist, then interact with them somehow. 

  Spent some time Figuring out a more logical way to set up the page-object structure. Navigation now handles all page visits
  and most wait button presses since it has the function that handles the regex, saving me some headcache.

  Also added a TestUtils.js file. It handles some simple tasks like removing paranthesis, removing some hassle.

  Did a lot of refactoring. Moved more functions into the TestUtils.js file instead of handling them separately in every file.
  Looks nice and is more logical.

  All tests currently work and can be ran concurrently, not experiencing any flakiness. Asserts work nicely. Even got the
  changeAccountSettings.spec.js file to work, though it will have to wait before getting any further attention due to the 
  pages delete function being very broken.
